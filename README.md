🧑‍💻 Front-End Development Practice – W3Schools Inspired Projects

As part of my front-end development journey, I’ve recreated several UI templates and components inspired by W3Schools, using HTML and CSS. These projects helped me strengthen my fundamentals and gain hands-on experience with real-world design patterns.

🔨 What I Built:

A fully responsive W3Schools homepage clone using CSS Grid and Flexbox

Clean and functional Navigation Bars

Custom Card layouts using Grid

A basic Landing Page structure with consistent styling

🎯 Key Concepts Practiced:

CSS Grid & Flexbox for layout structuring and alignment

Responsive design using media queries

Custom styling, hover effects, and transitions

Semantic HTML and modular CSS organization

💡 These practice projects helped me understand how to break down designs into clean, reusable components and build layouts that work seamlessly across devices. Recreating real-world UIs has been an excellent way to sharpen my front-end skills and improve my design-to-code workflow.
